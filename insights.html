<p>Based on the drawn Mealy machine diagram a program is synthesized for every State. 
The program looks as an if-else clause that contains all the conditional expressions 
from the Transitions exiting the State and the actions correspondingly. 
That program is executed, when the state machine is at the current State, with the 
Javascript engine. 
Such an execution corresponds to a state->nextstate axiom realization, that may modify 
the output variables, bring us to a new or remain in the current state - all depending 
on the diagram.
</p>

<p>Current implementation parses all conditions and actions to extract variable names 
that must be passed to the Javascript engine before the execution and read from it after 
the execution.
These variables must be declared, as it is described in 
<a href="io_definition.html" class="inner-link">Mealy state chart inputs and outputs</a>.
